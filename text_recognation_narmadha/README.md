# Text recognization using python-easyocr

## **Implementation of  optical character recognition algorithm using Python, OpenCV and EasyOCR**

This project helps to recognize a text from the image source.

Reading or Recognizing Text from Images is a challenging Task in the field of Computer Vision. This is mainly because Text in Images exhibit diversity and variability. Backgrounds of Images are virtually unpredictable as some images may have dark background, some may have light background and there are even cases where image fonts and background have same color with a small outline differentiating Text from the Background. There might be patterns of Text appearing in the image with different fonts, orientations, and varying lengths. The Text in Images can also be blurred or distorted

So to overcome these challenges i have oercame these challenges and came up with a solution to recognize a text from the image source.
